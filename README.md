# MindBound

MindBound is a voxel-based sandbox game with RPG elements baked into the sandbox. There will be many things to do, mobs to slay, items to craft, and areas to discover. 

Enriched by an extensive lore, the player must gain as much knowledge and technological advancement as possible to defeat the wretched Masteria, 
an advanced artificial intelligence that has entrapped Earth-dwellers in a simulation since the year 2105. 

Although in early stages of development, this project will be fervently worked on in the months to come. 

This repository serves as a collection of graphics, sounds, and textures of the game as the Design Team develops them.
